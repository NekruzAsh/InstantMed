We felt emotionally attached to this particular subject and field of tech in medicine. We knew we wanted to design a system that can help automate something simple yet complex. That is why we started to brainstorm our ideas and come up with an e-commerce website combined with logistics for delivering and ordering medicine on the go. Medpace offered the prize and was a perfect fit for our idea.
What it does

Our app lets you browse through library of different medicine allowing you to choose and add different products into your cart. Also, we have implemented an AI chat bot for the customers to ask questions about various illnesses and ask for medicine recommendations.
How we built it

We developed this web application using NextJS framework, Tailwind CSS, and also Pure CSS for individual components. We used Vercel to host our website. We also utilized a Cohere AI API to read user input text and give recommendations or feedback for the customer.
Challenges we ran into

At the start we had trouble implementing the AI chatbot because we started with different company AI APIs to test and we kept running out of tokens while testing## Inspiration We felt emotionally attached to this particular subject and field of tech in medicine.

At the start we had trouble implementing the AI chatbot because we started with different company AI APIs to test and we kept running out of tokens while testing our code. We also got into trouble of making the codespace and keeping the version control in place for the different team members to collaborate and learn more about GitHub platform along the way. At last, we had a few troubles designing custome elements using CSS and combining Tailwind CSS to speed up our development.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of being able to develop a full-stack web application that includes vanilla javaScript, React, and different backend processes that we were totally new to when we first building this project. We are particularly proud of learning more about the new technology stack that the software developers in the industry use. Overall, working together and bringing our ideas to life.
What we learned

We learned how to work in a team. We learned how to respect each other's ideas and contribute. We learned how to manage time in a time constrained environment and how to work at a fast pace bringing quality value.
What's next for InstantMed

We hope to take this to the next level and build the full backend platform for it that includes data bases and also mobile applications that will allow people to deliver medicine and order from their mobile application.## Inspiration We felt emotionally attached to this particular subject and field of tech in medicine.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
